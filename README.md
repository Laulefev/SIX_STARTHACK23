## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Data from financial markets is difficult to understand. People are often overwhelmed and ill-equipped to be able to make sense out of the data that might change their financial set up. Investor preferences are changing alongside consumer attitudes to key factors such as social, environmental and governance elements. ESG factors are becoming increasingly relevant not only for financial actors but for citizens of the world who wish to actively participate in change. Solutions in the market currently designed for highly literate users, they require a deep understanding of financial markets plus ESG. 

To acheive your mission, we grant you access to our brand new financial data API: SIX Web API. The API grants you access to data that describe the financial instruments, provide historical data, and prices in streaming mode. The API leverages REST/JSON, GraphQL and websocket technologies.



You can access:
Official ESG Data on more than 5000 investment funds.
Navigate in ESG folder for further details.

Our [API Portal](https://web.apiportal.six-group.com/portal/bfi/)
Sample codes in Javascript and Python are provided.
Navigate in the SIX Web Folder for more information.

## <p align="center"> Expected Outcome: </p>

- A creative solution to making financial data accessible and that can assist users in decision making.

- We expect a prototype solution that uses the data sets provided in creative ways
- A solution could be through visualization tools to illustrate the impact of social and environmental (ESG) investments of financial institutions and also help investors decide where to allocate their capital
